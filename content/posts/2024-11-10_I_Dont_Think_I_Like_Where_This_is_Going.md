YouTube's search feature has become absolutely unusable, which is a bit ironic coming from Google, of all companies.
The results tend to be like 5 videos that are actually (maybe) relevent to your search query, then it just gives up
in trying to be relevant and just reverts back to the algorithmic feed.

I joined Instagram shortly before they ruined the landing page, which I'm still inclined to call a timeline,
because at the time, thats what it was.
What you'd find on that original main page of Instagram was a chronological record of posts from people you follow.
The further you scroll, the more caught up you are with whats going on.

There was an algorithmic feed, but it was a choice. All you have to do is go to the "Explore" tab.

Now, the algorithmic feed isn't a choice anymore. The "Timeline" and "Explore" pages are effectively the same thing.
Without even leaving the home page, easily more than half of the posts I see are from accounts I dont follow,
and the posts aren't even in-order by time anymore.
There are even times when I don't see posts from my friends until a week later, or even more.

Instagram used to be a place to see when and what things were were going on with people I know.
But now the people I know are lost in the ocean of what the algorithm wants me to see.

"The Blackout" was a result of Reddit trying to crack down on the use of third party apps built on the Reddit API.
They ignored the fact that the third party apps were better in pretty much every way.
The problem was that these apps were getting away with not showing the ads that
Reddit was being paid to show to users in the first party app, and thats really what they cared most about.
