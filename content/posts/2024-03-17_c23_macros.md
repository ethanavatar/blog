Perhaps it was a mistake to learn Rust, because now that I've experienced errors-as-values, It feels like I will never be able to live without it, and every colaborative codebase I will ever work on from now on will be `try-catch` riddled agony. Actually, It's not even just at work. Even in my personal projects (which are rarely written in Rust nowadays), I sometimes find myself spending more time than I should implementing `Result` and a bunch of unnecessary composition methods to go along with it.

I don't think I'm alone in this, right? I'm willing to bet theres a lot of recovering Rust programmers who have had their fair share of trying to turn other languages into Rust.

On the other hand, I've been writing a lot of C recently. I think theres something nice about using a language that doesn't have any big ideas. It lets you focus more on actually getting things done instead of contemplating the spider-web of abstractions. Regardless, It doesn't keep me away from the urge of making it just a little bit more Rusty.

And the traditional ways of handling/categorizing errors in C basically amounts to returning `NULL` or `false` (and using out params), which leaves quite a bit to be desired in my opinion. So I like to believe my urge is a bit justified.

## The Beginning

Long story short, I want `Result` monads in C. The concept of it is pretty simple. It's just a struct that holds 2 potential values. So lets try that out on a sum function; for now, ignoring any error situations:

```c
typedef struct {
    int value;
    char *error;
} Result;

Result add(int a, int b) {
    return (Result) { .value = a + b };
}
```

This works, but the obvious problem is that this struct is not reusable at all, unless everything we use it in also returns `Result<int, char *>`. So my next idea was to leave the struct anonymous and define it directly in the function declaration without any typedef:

```c

struct { int value; char *error; } add(int a, int b) {
    // Hmmm
}
```

Believe it or not, this is a valid way to use a struct. But now the problem is that the struct isn't named, so now we can't even use it inside the function. But what if we just use a compound literal of a struct defined the same way? It'll be ugly, for sure, but it makes sense, right?

```c
struct { int value; char *error; } add(int a, int b) {
    return (struct { int value; char *error; }) { .value = a + b };
}
```

Yea, its pretty messy, but we can fix it in post (macros), so lets see--

```
<source>:6:12: error: returning 'struct (unnamed struct at <source>:7:9)' from a function with incompatible result type 'struct (unnamed struct at <source>:1:1)'
```

Oh, nevermind. Turns out that two identically defined anonymous structs will never be compatible with eachother, because the type checker doesn't actually care if they're identical, just if they are (or arent) the exact same type. This usually isn't an issue because C asks very few questions when a cast is involved, but that is already when both structs in question are named. So at this point it seems pretty hopeless to create a reusable Result monad in C.

## Enter C23

C23 was officially released recently. It has a few really exciting features, like `constexpr`, `#embed`, `auto`, and `typeof`; check out [this wonderful post from ThePhD](https://thephd.dev/c23-is-coming-here-is-what-is-on-the-menu) about some of the coolest things that come with C23. The ones that stuck out to me the most were `auto` and `typeof`, two features that come from C++, which is, as expected, a little bit controversial amongst the simplicity purists.

Starting with `typeof`, it is usually used to declare variables based on the type of a compile-time expression. For example:
  
```c
// int x = 1;
typeof(1) x = 1;
```

Interestingly, this also works in compund literals:

```c
struct { int a; } x;
x = (typeof(x)) { .a = 1 };
```

And, it can even get the return type of a function:

```c
char *hello() {
    return "Hello, Sailor!";
}

// char *x = hello();
typeof(hello()) x = hello();
```

This is exciting because it immediately solves the issue with two identical anonymous structs not being the same type. With `typeof`, we can get the actual anonymous struct instead of a different one that looks just like it. Now we can fix the code from before:

```c
struct { int value; char *error; } add(int a, int b) {
    return (typeof(add(0, 0))) { .value = a + b };
}
```

This actually compiles! And if we were to use this function, the `auto` keyword is there for the convinience of infering the type of the result struct:

```c
auto result = add(1, 2);

if (result.error) {
    printf("Error: %s\n", result.error);
} else {
    printf("Result: %d\n", result.value);
}
```

Now we can finally slap some macros over it and call it a day.

## The Macros

To start cleaning up and making the types more reusable, we can use a macro to define the return type of a function:

```c
#define RESULT(T, E) struct { bool is_ok; union { T value; E error; }; }
```

Notice the addition of the `is_ok` field. This is so we can tag the result and indicate which field is valid.
Also, `error` and `value` are now in a union, so they share the same space in memory, because only one of them will be used at a time.

Now, to clean up the return types, we can make macros for `OK` and `ERR`:

```c
#define OK(F, V) (typeof(F)) { .is_ok = true, .value = V }
#define ERR(F, E) (typeof(F)) { .is_ok = false, .error = E }
```

And now, we can implement a `checked_add` function that uses these macros, this time with checks for overflow and underflow:

```c
RESULT(int, char *) checked_add(int a, int b) {
    if ((b > 0) && (a > INT_MAX - b)) return ERR(checked_add(0, 0), "Overflow");
    if ((b < 0) && (a < INT_MIN - b)) return ERR(checked_add(0, 0), "Underflow");
    return OK(checked_add(0, 0), a + b);
}
```

That looks pretty nice in my opinion. The one minor downside is that a dummy function call needs to be passed to `ERR` and `OK` so they can properly cast the compound literal. It could be shortened by making a temporary macro, but im not sure how worth it that is. For example:

```c
#define T checked_add(0, 0)
RESULT(int, char *) checked_add(int a, int b) {
    if ((b > 0) && (a > INT_MAX - b)) return ERR(T, "Overflow");
    if ((b < 0) && (a < INT_MIN - b)) return ERR(T, "Underflow");
    return OK(T, a + b);
}
#undef T
```

And at the call site, the result can be infered with `auto` and error would be properly handled by checking the `is_ok` field of the result:

```c
int main() {
    auto result = checked_add(1, 2);

    if (!result.is_ok) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", result.error);
        return 1;
    }

    fprintf(stderr, "Result: %d\n", result.value);
}
```

But obviously, the preferable (lazy) way to do this is with `unwrap`. Which extracts the good value from the result and panics if the result wasn't ok. Here, I used a ternary so that the macro can be treated as an expression rather than a statement:

```c
void panic(const char *msg) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d Error: %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, msg);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
#define UNWRAP(R) ((R).is_ok ? (R).value : (panic("Unwrap error"), (R).error))
```

## Full code

Finally, this is everything put together:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define RESULT(T, E) struct { bool is_ok; union { T value; E error; }; }
#define OK(F, V) (typeof(F)) { .is_ok = true, .value = V }
#define ERR(F, E) (typeof(F)) { .is_ok = false, .error = E }

void panic(const char *msg) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d Error: %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, msg);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
#define UNWRAP(R) ((R).is_ok ? (R).value : (panic("Unwrap error"), (R).error))

#define T checked_add(0, 0)
RESULT(int, char *) checked_add(int a, int b) {
    if (a > 0 && b > INT_MAX - a) return ERR(T, "Int overflow");
    if (a < 0 && b < INT_MIN - a) return ERR(T, "Int underflow");
    return OK(T, a + b);
}
#undef T

int main(void) {
    int a = 34, b = 35;
    int c = UNWRAP(checked_add(34, 35));
    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
}
```

This is pretty nice in my opinion. At least its enough to help me sleep at night.
